### Teaching Philosophy
Broadening access to archaeology and higher education for students from diverse walks of life is imperative. In my teaching, I draw on universal design for learning (UDL) approaches to make class lectures and assignments accessible to students with different backgrounds and learning styles. I also emphasize writing, peer-editing, and re-writing in a supportive environment as a critical method for helping students become independent thinkers and scholars. Finally, I am committed to mentoring and advancing the capacities of African students and researchers, who are underserved compared to their colleagues in the US and Europe.
