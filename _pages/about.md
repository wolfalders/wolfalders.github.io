I am an anthropological archaeologist working on the East African Swahili Coast. I explore how non-elite, rural societies adapted to sociopolitical and environmental changes over the last two thousand years. Furthemore, I am committed to advancing international public and academic understandings of the significance and interconnectedness of precolonial Africa in world history.

Currently, I am a National Science Foundation SBE postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST) at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. I received my PhD from the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley in 2022. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Andrew Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

## Research Agenda 

### East African Social and Environmental Transformation
My research interests span the last 2000 years of East African history, from the earliest migrations of iron-working agriculturalists to the coast and offshore islands to the emergence of socially stratified mercantile societies before and after European and Omani colonialism in the region. I use settlement patterns and ceramic data to theorize about the integrative and autonomous activities of rural commoners, and the ways that bottom-up activities by these groups conditioned the emergence of nascent urban elites. I also use remote sensing and spatial statistics to analyze the environments that mediated specific dynamics within Swahili social systems. 

Urban, complex, socially-stratified societies are emergent human experiments with profound environmental impacts, the outcomes of which will have drastic implications for the course of our species and planet. Archaeology is uniquely suited for understanding the dynamics of social transformation at multiple long-term scales and in relation to different environmental factors. This is an urgent requirement of the present day in the face of multiple intersecting global challenges like climate change, political instability, and mass inequality. Off-shore islands on the Swahili Coast of East Africa like Zanzibar are ideal places for understanding these dynamics, since they were both A.) caught up in broader socioecological trends like the initial migration of early iron-working agriculturalists to the coast, Swahili urbanization and social stratification, integration within global trading systems, and colonialism, and B.) geographically and environmentally constrained as physical islands, making them uniquely suited for modeling social and environmental systems.

Currently, I am directing the Zanzibar Urban-Rural Complexity Project (ZURCP) in Zanzibar, Tanzania, to address these questions from the 8th to 19th centuries CE. This work involves survey in the hinterland of Zanzibar Stone Town, a precolonial Swahili stone town that grew into a wealthy urban mercantile entrep√¥t the 18th and 19th centuries. I have also just received a grant with colleagues at the University of Dar Es Salaam and the University of Sydney to look at early coastal adaptations to climate change and environmental disasters on the Tanzanian mainland.

### Geospatial Archaeology
Methodologically, my engagement is with geospatial technologies for archaeology. I use GNSS mapping, multispectral satellite imagery, historical maps, and spatial statistics to model environments and to help understand human settlement trends across large regions. In my work I seek to develop free and open-access methods for geospatial and archaeological research, enabling broader participation in archaeological science for places without the funding or licensing agreements to obtain cutting-edge geospatial hardware and software. In particular, I have translated GIS workflows from ArcGIS to QGIS and worked with low-cost satellite imagery, like PlanetScope.

### Community and Collaborative Engagements
I am committed to collaborative engagements with local communities and stakeholders, public outreach, and decolonial approaches to archaeological practice. In Zanzibar, this has meant practicing archaeology in the Swahili language, holding community meetings during and after field surveys, disseminating archaeological reports in Swahili to local communities, and training Tanzanian archaeologists. I have developing collaborations with the Department of Museums and Antiquities in Zanzibar, and the Department of Archaeology and Heritage Management at the University of Dar es Salaam.
