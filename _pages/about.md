I am an anthropological archaeologist interested in how ordinary people in the past produced and responded to environmental and social transformations. I currently conduct research in coastal East Africa.

I received my PhD from the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley in 2022. 

I am currently an NSF SBE postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST) at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Andrew Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

### Research Agenda: The Archaeology of Social and Environmental Transformation
Urban, complex, socially-stratified societies are emergent human experiments, the outcomes of which will have drastic implications for the course of our species and planet. Archaeology is uniquely suited for understanding the dynamics of social transformation at multiple long-term scales and in relation to different environmental factors. This is an urgent requirement of the present day in the face of multiple intersecting global challenges like climate change, political instability, and mass inequality.

I use archaeology to understand how common people in the past responded to emergent socioecological changes. To this end, I am investigating rural and non-elite complexity in coastal East Africa, a region shaped by multiple factors of social change over the last millennium, including the initial colonization of the coast and off-shore islands by agriculturalists, urbanization, integration within global trading systems, and colonialism. 

My current project uses geospatial methods and archaeological field surveys to understand rural settlement trends, ceramic production, and daily life in the immediate countryside of Zanzibar Stone Town, in Zanzibar, Tanzania, from the 6th to 19th centuries CE. I ask how rural communities around this center created resilient communities across different types of marginal environments, and supported, challenged, or withdrew from nascent systems of power and wealth.

### Geospatial Archaeology
Methodologically, my main engagement is with geospatial technologies for archaeology. I use high-resolution GNSS mapping, multispectral satellite imagery, historical maps, and spatial statistics to help understand human settlement trends across large regions. In my work I seek to develop free and open-access methods for geospatial and archaeological research, enabling broader participation in archaeological science for places without the funding or licensing agreements to obtain cutting-edge geospatial hardware and software. In particular, I have translated GIS workflows from ArcGIS to QGIS and worked with low-cost satellite imagery, like PlanetScope.

### Community and Collaborative Engagements
I am committed to collaborative engagements with local communities and stakeholders, public outreach, and decolonial approaches to archaeological practice. In Zanzibar, this has meant practicing archaeology in the Swahili language, holding community meetings during and after field surveys, disseminating archaeological reports in Swahili to local communities, and training Tanzanian archaeologists. I have developing collaborations with the Department of Museums and Antiquities in Zanzibar, and the Department of Archaeology and Heritage Management at the University of Dar es Salaam.
