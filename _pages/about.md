I am an environmental and anthropological archaeologist investigating how rural and non-elite people adapted to and participated in dynamic urban and rural systems within the tropical maritime environments of the East African Swahili Coast. I am currently a National Science Foundation SBE postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST) at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.

I use settlement patterns and ceramic data to theorize about the integrative and autonomous activities of rural commoners, non-elites, and dependents, and the ways that bottom-up activities by these groups conditioned the emergence of social elites. I use field surveys, remote sensing, and geospatial statistics to understand and analyze the objects, environments, and landscapes that mediated the specific dynamics of Swahili social systems.

My research itnerests span the last 2000 years of East African history, from the earliest migrations of iron-working agriculturalists to the coast and offshore islands to the emergence of socially stratified mercantile societies before and after European and Omani colonialism in the region. I am currently directing the Zanzibar Urban-Rural Complexity Project (ZURCP), which uses systematic field surveys, spatial statistical modeling, and satellite remote sensing to investigate rural and non-elite complexity in Zanzibar, Tanzania from the 7th to 19th centuries CE.

I received my PhD from the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley in 2022. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Andrew Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

## Research Agenda 

### Social and Environmental Transformations
More broadly, I am interested in the intersections of climate, the environment, and social complexity. Urban, complex, socially-stratified societies are emergent human experiments with profound environmental impacts, the outcomes of which will have drastic implications for the course of our species and planet. Archaeology is uniquely suited for understanding the dynamics of social transformation at multiple long-term scales and in relation to different environmental factors. This is an urgent requirement of the present day in the face of multiple intersecting global challenges like climate change, political instability, and mass inequality. Off-shore islands on the Swahili Coast of East Africa like Zanzibar are ideal places for understanding these dynamics, since they were both A.) caught up in broader socioecological trends like the initial migration of early iron-working agriculturalists to the coast, Swahili urbanization and social stratification, integration within global trading systems, and colonialism, and B.) geographically and environmentally constrained as physical islands, making them uniquely suited for modeling social and environmental systems.

### Geospatial Archaeology
Methodologically, my main engagement is with geospatial technologies for archaeology. I use high-resolution GNSS mapping, multispectral satellite imagery, historical maps, and spatial statistics to help understand human settlement trends across large regions. In my work I seek to develop free and open-access methods for geospatial and archaeological research, enabling broader participation in archaeological science for places without the funding or licensing agreements to obtain cutting-edge geospatial hardware and software. In particular, I have translated GIS workflows from ArcGIS to QGIS and worked with low-cost satellite imagery, like PlanetScope.

### Community and Collaborative Engagements
I am committed to collaborative engagements with local communities and stakeholders, public outreach, and decolonial approaches to archaeological practice. In Zanzibar, this has meant practicing archaeology in the Swahili language, holding community meetings during and after field surveys, disseminating archaeological reports in Swahili to local communities, and training Tanzanian archaeologists. I have developing collaborations with the Department of Museums and Antiquities in Zanzibar, and the Department of Archaeology and Heritage Management at the University of Dar es Salaam.
