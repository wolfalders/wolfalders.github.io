I am an anthropological archaeologist interested in understanding how ordinary people in the past dealt with periods of systemic social transformation. I currently conduct research in coastal East Africa.

I received my PhD from the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley in 2022. 

I am currently an NSF SBE postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST) at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Andrew Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

### Research Agenda: The Archaeology of Social Transformation
Urban, complex, socially-stratified societies are emergent human experiments, the outcomes of which will have drastic implications for the course of our species and planet. As we hurtle through history faster than any of our ancestors could have imagined, it is of vital importance that we better understand how processes of social transformation unfolded. This is an urgent requirement of the present day in the face of multiple intersecting global challenges like climate change, political instability, and mass inequality. Archaeology is uniquely suited for understanding the dynamics of social transformation at multiple long-term scales.

In particular, I am interested in using archaeology to understand how common people in the past responded to emergent social changes in complex, socially diverse and socially stratified societies. To this end, I am investigating rural and non-elite complexity in coastal East Africa, a region shaped by multiple factors of social change over the last millennium, including urbanization, integration within global trading systems, and colonialism. 

My current project uses geospatial methods and archaeological field surveys to understand rural settlement trends, ceramic production, and daily life in the immediate countryside of Zanzibar Stone Town, in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Founded in the 11th century as a Swahili urban center, Zanzibar Stone Town became the wealthiest city on the East African coast during the colonial era as a mercantile city, as the capital of the Busaid Omani Empire, and as a central hub of the East African trade in enslaved people. I ask how rural communities around this center supported, challenged, or withdrew from systems of power and wealth over the last thousand years, and pursued integrative or autonomous strategies at different times, places, and scales.

### Geospatial Archaeology
Methodologically, my main engagement is with geospatial technologies for archaeology. I use high-resolution GNSS mapping, multispectral satellite imagery, historical maps, and spatial statistics to help understand human settlement trends across large regions. In my work I seek to develop free and open-access methods for geospatial and archaeological research, enabling broader participation in archaeological science for places without the funding or licensing agreements to obtain cutting-edge geospatial hardware and software. In particular, I have translated GIS workflows from ArcGIS to QGIS and worked with low-cost satellite imagery, like PlanetScope.

### Community Engagement
I am committed to collaborative engagements with local communities and stakeholders, public outreach, and decolonial approaches to archaeological practice. In Zanzibar, this has meant practicing archaeology in the Swahili language, holding community meetings during and after field surveys, disseminating archaeological reports in Swahili to local communities, and training Tanzanian archaeologists.
