I am an anthropological archaeologist working on the East African Swahili Coast. I explore how rural, non-elite communities adapted to sociopolitical and environmental instability over the last two thousand years, and shaped the composition and dynamics of hierarchical, urban, mercantile polities in the western Indian Ocean. Furthermore, I am committed to advancing international public and academic understandings of the significance and interconnectedness of African societies in world history.

Currently, I am a National Science Foundation SBE postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST) at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. I received my PhD from the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley in 2022. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Andrew Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

## Why Africa?
Why do archaeology in Africa? As an anthropological archaeologist, I am motivated by big questions: how do humans produce and respond to social inequality? How do we adapt to instability in our environments and our sociopolitical systems? What social processes led humans to start living in large, complex, urban societies, with specialized labor and food production? These societies are emergent human experiments with profound environmental impacts, the outcomes of which will have drastic implications for the course of our species and planet.

What African archaeology demonstrates is that urbanism, food production, inequality, and social complexity developed along unique and diverse trajectories on the continent, in ways that continually force us to rethink and problematize global anthropological understandings of these processes. For instance, in East Africa, urban mercantile societies coexisted alongside hunter-gatherer, pastoralist, and intensified agriculturalist foodways for many centuries. Concurrently, societies in West Africa settled in large, urban communities that did not exhibit the monumentality and hierarchical structures associated with stratified societies elsewhere. In southern Africa, elites accumulated and mobilized social wealth in ways that lead us to rethink assumptions about the relationship between control over land, surplus, and social inequality.

Africa has enormous global significance but it is a vastly understudied, and therefore misunderstood, region of the world. Investigating these processes also means countering outdated assumptions about Africa, like the notion that its societies were historically static, or dominated by environmental factors. These ideas could not be further from the truth, and archaeology is uniquely suited to reveal the dynamic societies of the African past, and help to address challenges of the African and global present.

## Research Agenda 
My research spans the last 2000 years of East African history, from the earliest migrations of iron-working agriculturalists to the coast and offshore islands to the emergence of socially stratified mercantile societies before and after colonialism. This long-term approach aims to bridge disciplinary siloes of prehistory-history or precolonial-colonial periodization which artificially limit our understandings of social processes. In my research, I have investigated urbanism, colonial contact, and adaptations to climate and environmental instability. All of my projects are united by an attention to the strategies of non-elite, rural, and small-scale communities, and how these groups shaped broader sociopolitical and environmental systems.

### Swahili Urbanism
Currently, I am directing the Zanzibar Urban-Rural Complexity Project (ZURCP) in Zanzibar, Tanzania, to investigate rural and non-elite responses to urbanization from the 8th to 19th centuries CE in the hinterland of Zanzibar Stone Town, a precolonial Swahili stone town that grew into a wealthy urban mercantile entrep√¥t the 18th and 19th centuries. Off-shore islands on the Swahili Coast of East Africa like Zanzibar are ideal places for understanding these dynamics, since they were both A.) caught up in broader socioecological trends like the initial migration of early iron-working agriculturalists to the coast, Swahili urbanization and social stratification, integration within global trading systems, and colonialism, and B.) geographically and environmentally constrained as physical islands, making them uniquely suited for modeling social and environmental systems.

Surveys have clarified a model of island settlement by Swahili agriculturalists, demonstrating that coastal stream networks and specific soil zones shaped the eventual emergence of Stone Town as a central place. Rural stone mortuary complexes also reflect rural Swahili investments into territoriality as colonial rulers sought to exploit limited agricultural land in favorable environmental zones. With ceramic data, I have started to theorize about the integrative and autonomous activities of rural commoners, and the ways that participation by these groups within patron-client systems conditioned the emergence of urbanism.

### Colonial Contact, Plantation Systems, and Indigenous Persistence
My dissertation research looked at the adaptations of rural Swahili communities that preceded and persisted through the establishment of plantation societies on Zanzibar by Omani settlers in the 19th century.

### Climate Change and Environmental Instability
With colleagues at the University of Dar Es Salaam and the University of Sydney, I have begun a project that is investigating early coastal adaptations to climate change and environmental disasters on the Tanzanian mainland, at Pangani Bay.

### Geospatial Archaeology
Methodologically, my engagement is with geospatial technologies for archaeology. I use GNSS mapping, multispectral satellite imagery, historical maps, and spatial statistics to model environments and to help understand human settlement trends across large regions. In my work I seek to develop free and open-access methods for geospatial and archaeological research, enabling broader participation in archaeological science for places without the funding or licensing agreements to obtain cutting-edge geospatial hardware and software. In particular, I have translated GIS workflows from ArcGIS to QGIS and worked with low-cost satellite imagery, like PlanetScope.

One advantage of geospatial modeling and high-resolution, low-cost satellite and UAV imagery is that it enables our teams to plan archaeological prospection within the interstices of rapidly urbanizing cities. The future of the world is urban, and archaeologists will increasingly need to deal with survey and excavation in urbanizing places. Africa is urbanizing at the fastest rate of anywhere on the planet, so methodologies for investigating and conserving archaeological heritage in formerly rural places are urgently needed. To address this aim, my project has developed innovative systematic survey methods for recovering archaeological sites around Zanzibar City in Tanzania.

### Community and Collaborative Engagements
I am committed to collaborative engagements with local communities and stakeholders, public outreach, and decolonial approaches to archaeological practice. In Zanzibar, this has meant practicing archaeology in the Swahili language, holding community meetings during and after field surveys, disseminating archaeological reports in Swahili to local communities, and training Tanzanian archaeologists. I have developing collaborations with the Department of Museums and Antiquities in Zanzibar, and the Department of Archaeology and Heritage Management at the University of Dar es Salaam.
